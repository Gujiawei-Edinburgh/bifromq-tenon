//! Runner-side ownership and transport interface for one Pipeline process.
//!
//! Management resolves runnable targets and consumes applied states through this
//! module. The supervisor starts one process owner for each attempt and retains
//! its own latest target, working directory, and restart policy. The process
//! owner keeps its connection, published revisions, and exact control directory
//! together until explicit cleanup. Control and diagnostics adapters share the
//! launch registry; the control server only assembles their transports.
