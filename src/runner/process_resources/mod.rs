//! Aggregate process limits at the Runner's operating-system boundary.

//! A launch owns its resource group alongside its process tree. Preparation
//! completes before exec; explicit cleanup proves the group empty before
//! runtime files are removed. Startup recovery only visits Tenon's workload
//! subtree in the deployment-provided scope. No cgroup path is public config.
//! Limits are derived from verified Documents, never retained as shadow state.
