//! Pipeline process-group and Runner direct-child lifecycle.
//!
//! Every Pipeline is the leader of a private POSIX process group. Source and
//! Sink processes inherit that group, so the Runner can terminate every live
//! descendant even after the direct Pipeline child has exited. Normal
//! shutdown still signals only the Pipeline and lets it close Plugins in order;
//! the process-group signal is the final cleanup boundary.
